				 CSCI 4391/5931
				Assignment 4

In this assignment you are to implement and test two Lisp functions. The first
of which is a modification to a function that you have already seen:

Function 1:
Modify the drop-value function to be able to drop a value from any given list
no matter how deep the value is in the list. You can call the function 
drop-all.

For example: 

(drop-all 'a '(1 2 a b 3 a c d a 8)) should result in
(1 2 b 3 c d 8)

(drop-all 'a '(1 2 (a b c (a d (f a))) x (a y) w a 3 5 a )) should result in
(1 2 (b c (d (f))) x (y) w 3 5)


Function 2: 
Implement a function that finds the numbers in a list no matter how deep 
they are in the list.

For example:

(find-nums '(a b 2 4 d 8 c 3 w w w 5)) should result in
(2 4 8 3 5)

(find-nums '(1 2 (3 a b) (w 3 4 (7 9 d) b) 5 a b )) should result in
(1 2 3 3 4 7 9 5)

Place both functions in one Lisp file (assignment4.lsp) and submit via 
Blackboard.

Good Luck
